Nicholas (Nick) LaFarge received a Bachelor of Arts in Computational Mathematics and Japanese from the University of Colorado Boulder in 2014 and a Master of Science in Aeronautics and Astronautics from Purdue University in 2020. After his bachelors, he spent two years working in the software industry before finding his way toward the intersection of his many interests by studying astrodynamics at Purdue. Nick participated in an internship at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 2017, working on an interactive tool for computing multi-body orbit connections in Monte. Starting in 2018, Nick has been a Graduate Pathways Co-Op at Johnson Space Center, working on automated onboard processes for rendezvous, proximity operations, and docking for Orion. Nick was awarded a NASA Space Technology Research Fellowship in 2019, and is currently pursing research in applying reinforcement learning to automated inflight multi-body guidance. In his free time, Nick enjoys traveling, backpacking, rock climbing, audiobooks, and hiking.
